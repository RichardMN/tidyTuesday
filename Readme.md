This repo is intended to pull together my occasional attempts at [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) exercises.

My first is for 10 January 2023, inspired by spending a lot of time playing Wingspan and by Cara Thompson's much cleaner chart. But I looked at it earlier this week and figured, "I think I know how to do that."

This is not such a clear chart but brings a touch of visual. The [arthistory data package](https://saralemus7.github.io/arthistory/) presents data on how much space individual artists get in art history books from 1926 to 2020. There is a lot more detail and many more stories to be told but I wanted to quickly look at nationalities - how much "space" each of the top five take up.
